# Jana Kaufmanová

I‘m minimalist designer, who finds beauty in simplicity and elegance. I consider myself as an introverted person, who may not say much, but has a universe inside her head. I am fond of anything that involves art itself, designs, textures, and patterns (mostly in love with typography and illustrations).
