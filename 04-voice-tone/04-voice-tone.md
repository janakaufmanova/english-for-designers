# My story of copying 
When I was a little girl, I though that copying someone or something was totally illegal and I was really scared to do it. 
Making illustrations  (in czech památník) was really a big thing at that time. Everyone in my class and all my closest friends owned their *Memory book* full off illustrations. It was something like a collection, that you carried with you all the time. The goal was to give it to one of your friends to draw something really nice for you (in memory). 

It was an honor, when you got one of those memory books from your clasemates or your friends. Everyone always felt the pressure, that the drawing must be perfect, and you couldn’t mess it up. “Your page is going to be as pretty as the others” I repeated myself all the time. But when I overthinking something, and  focus too much, I always mess things up. 

So I came up with a really good idea. I bought one of those tracing papers and started copying illustrations from all sort of books. My illustrations were perfect, but they were never mine. My classmates were pleased, and I was relieved, that I did a great job. (It was that time of my life, when I couldn’t even imagine, that I would be able to work in art industry, and that my imagination isn’t too bad. 

So my common sense, my good childish intentions, were right. I think It is absolutely ok to be inspired by other people and see art from another perspective. But let your brain think individually and make your own point of view on it. Copying someone and publish it as yours is not human.
