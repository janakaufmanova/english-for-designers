# Visual Identity of Třinec Gallery

The main topic of this bachelor's thesis is the analysis of the visual identity of the Třinec Gallery and its subsequent redesign. The bachelor's thesis was written in collaboration with this gallery and its management, as the institution is aware of deficiencies in their communication and visual strategy.

The theoretical part of the thesis is first defining the concept of graphic design, which is one of the crucial concepts in creating visual and communication identity of any institution. The thesis furthermore analyses and compares czech and foreign cultural institutions, also being located in industrial regions as Třinec is, and it will analyse whether their visual communication in the segment is functioning and what are possible differences between the institutions and their communications. 

The practical part focuses on creating a functioning unified visual style that will be suitable for this segment and will serve as an element to communicate with the inhabitants of the city and the region and will be suitable for raising awareness of the cultural industry in the Třinec region.
