# Visual Identity of Třinec Gallery

The main topic of this bachelor's thesis is the analysis of the visual identity of the Třinec Gallery and its subsequent redesign. The bachelor's thesis was written in collaboration with this gallery and its management, as the institution is aware of deficiencies in their communication and visual strategy.

The theoretical part focuses on the definition of basic concepts in the field of graphic design and cultural industry. The theoretical part focuses also on the position of the cultural industry in the Czech Republic and in the region of Třinec. In order to determine the best strategy for the redesign of the visual identity of the Třinec Gallery, 3 cultural institutions in the industrial region in the Czech Republic are also selected for the purpose of defining and determining the best strategy. For this purpose, the method of so-called SWOT analysis is needed, which is able to select marketing strategies for the Třinec City Gallery, defining strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats in the given context and the goal of competition.

The practical part focuses on creating a functioning unified visual style that will be suitable for this segment and will serve as an element to communicate with the inhabitants of the city and the region and will be suitable for raising awareness of the cultural industry in the Třinec region.
